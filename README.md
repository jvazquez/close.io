Exam
====

Given a list in variable `x`, write a one-line Python generator expression that returns only the elements from x that are odd integers or have an even (zero-based) index in `x`. The given list may contain items other than numbers. The solution must be a generator expression.


## Solution

My solution is on exam.py
Before, you should run random_generator to create a list
with random words and numbers.

After that, just run exam.py and there you will have the solution.

I was bored and decided to add multiprocessing and fetch random words from a curl call
